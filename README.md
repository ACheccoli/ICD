# ICD
This is a tiny repo containing ipynb files and ICD model-related files.

Running simulations on ICD models is possible if 3 files have been previously downloaded and hence, are accessible from the ipynb file working directory. Every simulation need a model description file (.bnd) a model config file (.cfg) and the population update file (.upp).
